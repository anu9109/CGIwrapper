Description: Cancer Genome Interpreter (CGI) is designed to support the identification of tumor alterations 
    that drive the disease and detect those that may be therapeutically actionable. CGI relies on existing 
    knowledge collected from several resources and on computational methods that annotate the alterations 
    in a tumor according to distinct levels of evidence. This wrapper talks to the CGI API and will: 
    check API and authentication status, submit a job given input files, download analysis results, and 
    delete the job from the server.
